Advanced Image Search for Linux
----------------------


The purpose of this library are command line tools that enable content-aware image browsing from the CLI..

lsimg for example ( which is the first implemented application ) should be able to return images which are larger than a specific resolution , that contain faces , that are similar to another one , that are bright ( histograms ) , that have been taken in a specific Longitude/Latitude ( EXIF ) etc..

Of course some of this functionality is theoretical for now , you can view implemented functionality by issuing "lsimg - help"

--------------- Library Dependencies ---------------
Requires libjpeg , libpng , opencv and gcc to be compiled!
OpenCV should be a version after 2.4 since nonfree components of it got seperated from the main library and we use them in this lib..
In case you run into problems with lib dependencies or don't want them at all in your system consider deactivating the features you don't want by switching them off from src/AdvancedImageSearchLib/configuration.h

Requires exif tool ( sudo apt-get install exif ) for JPG exif functionality
The project contains a script to solve dependencies using pacman or apt-get as package managers
You can perform automatic download of required dependencies by issuing : ./get-dependencies.sh



--------------- Compilation ---------------
In order to make the project simply issue
make 
It will create a local copy of the binaries



--------------- Installation of current version---------------
In order to install lsimg and the AdvancedImageSearch to your system you can do it
issuing 
./install.sh
your password is required.. 

In order to remove the project you can use the uninstall script by issuing
./uninstall.sh





------------------------------ Examples ------------------------------
Sample usage of lsimg :

It will move all images smaller than 640x480 to the subdir small!
 mv `lsimg -maxDims 640 480 /home/me/Pictures/Wallpapers/Raw` Small/
 
It will move all images suitable for wallpaper ( larger than 1680x1050 ) to the wallpaper dir!
 mv `lsimg -minDims 1680 1050 /home/me/Downloads/` /home/me/Pictures/Wallpapers/Raw/
 
It will move all images suitable for wallpaper that are "red" ( larger than 1680x1050 ) to the red wallpaper dir!
 mv `lsimg -color red -minDims 1680 1050 /home/me/Downloads/` /home/me/Pictures/Wallpapers/Red/

Find all images like ~/me.jpg in ~/Downloads direcotry 
lsimg -like ~/me.jpg ~/Downloads/

Open all the "green" images with gpicview
cd ~/Downloads
lsimg -color green ./ | xargs -n 1 gpicview #
