The purpose of this library are command line tools that enable content-aware image browsing from the CLI..

lsimg for example ( which is the first implemented application ) should be able to return images which are larger than a specific resolution , that contain faces , that are similar to another one , that are bright ( histograms ) , that have been taken in a specific Longitude/Latitude ( EXIF ) etc..

Of course this functionality is highly theoretical for now , but I hope I will have time to implement at least some of them
