The purpose of this library are command line tools that enable content-aware image browsing from the CLI..

lsimg for example ( which is the first implemented application ) should be able to return images which are larger than a specific resolution , that contain faces , that are similar to another one , that are bright ( histograms ) , that have been taken in a specific Longitude/Latitude ( EXIF ) etc..

Of course this functionality is highly theoretical for now , but I hope I will have time to implement at least some of them 


Requires libjpeg , libpng , gcc to be compiled!
Requires exif tool ( sudo apt-get install exif ) for JPG exif functionality

./install.sh adds the binaries to the system



Sample usage of lsimg

It will move all images smaller than 640x480 to the subdir small!
 mv `lsimg -maxDims 640 480 /home/me/Pictures/Wallpapers/Raw` Small/



It will move all images suitable for wallpaper ( larger than 1680x1050 ) to the wallpaper dir!
 mv `lsimg -minDims 1680 1050 /home/me/Downloads/` /home/me/Pictures/Wallpapers/Raw/
